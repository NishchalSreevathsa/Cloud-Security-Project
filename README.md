**Project1: Securing Cloud Infrastructure: AWS IAM-Based Access Control for Scalable and Safe Intern Onboarding.**
This project focuses on implementing cloud security best practices using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to safeguard critical infrastructure while supporting seasonal business expansion. Two Amazon EC2 instances were deployed to represent distinct production and development environments. A scalable access control policy was established whereby interns were granted limited access exclusively to the development environment—ensuring protection of production workloads. IAM users, groups, and roles were configured to enforce least privilege principles, and an AWS Account Alias was assigned to improve login clarity and user management.
With the onset of the holiday season, the project also prepared the company’s infrastructure to handle increased traffic from new users, while efficiently onboarding an intern with secure, role-appropriate permissions—balancing accessibility with operational resilience.
